/**
 * AddPlace is a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) class used to represent the request payload for the Add Place API.
 * It is primarily used for serialization, where Java objects are converted into JSON before sending the API request using Rest Assured.
 * The class contains private member variables that correspond to the fields in the JSON payload, along with public getter and setter methods for each variable.
 * OOP Concepts:
 * - Encapsulation: Private fields with public getters/setters to control access.
 * - Composition: Contains a Location object as a field, demonstrating has-a relationship.
 * Framework Feature: POJOs enable easy mapping between Java objects and JSON for API payloads.
